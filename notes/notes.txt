We want to compute
f(A)x 
where 
f(A) = expm(A)

We are using an impicit Schur decomposition by Lanczos algorithm. This is used since A is hermitian (since G is an undirected graph)

A = QTQ*  (after Lanczos -- U unitary)
A =  QV Lambda V*Q*
f(A) = QVf(\Lambda)V*U*
f(A)v = U-V_H-f(\Lambda)-V_H*-U*-v

We are using the formula

y \approx norm(x) Q
