This project computes the action of the matrix exponential on a vector (usually of ones) both in serial and in parallel.

Data needs to be downloaded from and untarred. Please replace the empty ```data/``` directory with the untarred ```data.tar```.

Find serial implementation in ```serial/``` 
- For details of how to run code in ```serial/``` see ```serial/README.md```
